# Lamprey-CRE-Map

This repository contains a comparative pipeline for enhancer prediction and annotation in *Petromyzon marinus*. It includes epigenomic data integration, motif analysis, and TFBS grammar modeling for key neural crest genes such as *tfap2a*, *soxE*, and *foxd3*.

## Features
- Enhancer discovery near neural crest regulators
- Motif co-occurrence, spacing, and enrichment scoring
- PhastCons conservation analysis
- Heatmaps and annotated CSV outputs
- Reproducible environment with Zenodo support
